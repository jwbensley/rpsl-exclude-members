<t>This document updates <xref target="RFC2622"/> and <xref target="RFC4012"/> by defining the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute on as-set and route-set classes in the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL). This new attribute allows operators to overcome limitations of the existing syntax, which currently only supports the implicit inclusion of everything contained within an as-set or route-set.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>The Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) <xref target="RFC2622"/> defines the as-set and route-set classes. These sets can either reference a direct member of the set (such as an AS number, IP prefix, etc.), or additional sets which themselves have their own direct members and/or reference yet more sets, ad infinitum. Server and client software can follow these references to recursively resolve all the members of a set i.e., until all references have been resolved leaving a set of prefixes or ASes.</t>

<section anchor="existing-methods-of-inclusion"><name>Existing Methods of Inclusion</name>

<t>The existing RPSL syntax allows for members of an as-set or route-set to be specified in multiple ways:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t><xref target="RFC2622"/> defines the <spanx style="verb">members</spanx> attribute.
  <list style="numbers" type="1">
      <t><xref section="5.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC2622"/> defines that for an as-set this attribute stores one or more primary keys, each referencing an aut-num or or as-set object.</t>
      <t>Sections <xref target="RFC2622" section="5.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> and <xref target="RFC2622" section="5.3" sectionFormat="bare"/> of <xref target="RFC2622"/> and  defines that for a route-set this attribute may store one or more primary keys, each referencing a route-set object which optionally has a range operator appended, an aut-num, or an as-set. Alternatively, the <spanx style="verb">members</spanx> attribute on a route-set may store an IPv4 address prefix range directly i.e., not an RPSL primary key that points directly to route object, and that prefix range is used to identify matching route objects. That address prefix range may optionally have a range operator appended.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t><xref section="4.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC4012"/> defines the <spanx style="verb">mp-members</spanx> attribute for route-sets. This attribute may store one or more primary keys, each referencing a route-set object which optionally has a range operator appended, or an IPv4 address prefix range directly, or an IPv6 address prefix range directly. Although not explicitly stated in RFC4012, implementations of the <spanx style="verb">mp-members</spanx> attributes have based it on the RFC2622 definition and allowed the attribute to also store the RPSL primary key of aut-nums and as-sets.</t>
  <t><xref target="RFC2622"/> defines the <spanx style="verb">mbrs-by-ref</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">member-of</spanx> attributes.
  <list style="numbers" type="1">
      <t><xref section="5.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC2622"/> defines that for an as-set these attributes allow for the inclusion of aut-nums in the as-set, iff the criteria defined in the RFC linking both attributes together is met.</t>
      <t><xref section="5.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC2622"/> defines that for a route-set these attributes allow for the inclusion of routes in the route-set, iff the criteria defined in the RFC linking both attributes together is met.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t><xref section="3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC4012"/> defines the router6 class along with the <spanx style="verb">member-of</spanx> attribute on that class, and as a result, allows for the inclusion of route6 objects in a route-set, iff the criteria relating to <spanx style="verb">mbrs-by-ref</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">member-of</spanx> attributes defined in <xref section="5.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC2622"/> is met.</t>
</list></t>

<t>When using the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute to include an as-set or route-set (hereinafter the "included set") inside another as-set or route-set (hereinafter the "including set"), all members of the included set are included in the including set. This is not limited to the members directly nested inside the included set, but all members recursively included all the way down the RPSL hierarchy. This implicit recursive inclusion logic is herein referred to as "greedy" logic.</t>

<t>In the figure below, the as-set <spanx style="verb">AS-EXAMPLE-1</spanx> only includes one member but, as a result of that single inclusion, AS-EXAMPLE-1 now contains the aut-nums AS65001, AS65002, and AS65003:</t>

<figure title="A three level hierarchy is created even though AS-EXAMPLE-1 only includes one additional as-set"><sourcecode type="rpsl"><![CDATA[
as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-1
members: AS-EXAMPLE-2

as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-2
members: AS65001, AS65002, AS-EXAMPLE-3

as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-3
members: AS65003
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>The same inclusion logic applies to a route-set which references another route-set, as-set, or aut-num, in the <spanx style="verb">members</spanx> attribute; everything inside the included set, all the way down the recursed tree, is implicitly included into the including set.</t>

<t>Similarly greedy logic also applies to prefixes too; the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute of a route-set includes any route/route6 objects which match the IPv4/6 address prefix range and optional range operator.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="existing-methods-of-exclusion"><name>Existing Methods of Exclusion</name>

<t>The filter-set class and <spanx style="verb">filter</spanx> attribute are defined in <xref section="5.4" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC2622"/>. Correspondingly, the <spanx style="verb">mp-filter</spanx> attribute was later defined in <xref section="2.5.2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC4012"/>. Together these attributes provide a method for declaring in the IRR ecosystem the prefixes a network will not accept.</t>

<t>Additionally, the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)filter</spanx> attribute may be used to exclude route/route6 objects which have been included by the greedy logic of the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute of a route-set. This is achieved by first including all route/route6 objects which match the IPv4/6 address prefix range and optional range operator in the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute on the route-set, and then removing any route/route6 objects from this result which match the IPv4/6 address prefix range and optional range operator in the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute of the filter-set.</t>

<t>For as-sets and route-sets which use the <spanx style="verb">mbrs-by-ref</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">member-of</spanx> attributes, both attributes have to contain corresponding values. This already reduces the greediness of the inclusion logic. It is also already possible to further reduce the greediness. This can be achieved by changing the value of <spanx style="verb">mbrs-by-ref</spanx> from ANY to a list of specific values, and/or by removing the as-set or route-set primary key from the <spanx style="verb">members-of</spanx> attribute of an aut-num or route/route6 object.</t>

<t>There is currently no method to exclude either an aut-num, an as-set, or a route-set, which was included by the greedy logic of the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute of an as-set or route-set object.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="missing-methods-of-exclusion"><name>Missing Methods of Exclusion</name>

<t>The existing greedy logic of the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute of as-sets and route-sets, coupled with the inability to alter this logic, can result in various undesired effects for operators. A non-exhaustive list of possible undesirable outcomes follows:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t>A member is added to a set which is not connected to or related to the network operated by the owner of the including set. This allows the including set owner to originate prefixes they aren't authorised to originate. Upstreams and peers of the network owning the including set, aren't able to generate an IRR derived prefix or AS path filter which excludes the unauthorised included set. Note that this can happen anywhere in the set hierarchy; the unauthorised include may be nested many levels down within the including set used by a peer or upstream, making it difficult to get included set removed.</t>
  <t>A member is added to a set which creates a loop when the set is resolved (set A contains set B which contains set A). This can lead to IRR derived prefix or AS path filters either massively expanding in size, or simply not being resolvable.</t>
  <t>A member is added to a set, that set is intended to contain a network's downstreams, but the included set relates to a peer or upstream, not a downstream. The operator of the including set now becomes a transit provider for the operator of the included set. This can also lead to IRR derived prefix or AS path filters massively expanding in size.</t>
  <t>A member is added to a set which relates to an operator who's actions violate a law, a geo-political agreement, or the connectivity terms and conditions, of a peer or upstream of the including set operator. The peer or upstream has no choice but to exclude the included set from their peer's or downstream's IRR derived prefix or AS path filters. However, this currently requires a custom and potentially manual workaround, as there is no standard mechanism to support this in an automated manor.</t>
  <t>A member is added to a set with whom a peer or upstream of the including set operator already has a direct relation. A regulatory requirement may restrict the peer or upstream from exchanging traffic with the operator of the included set via the including set operator, or via any 3rd party operator.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This document updates the RPSL definition in <xref target="RFC4012"/> by introducing the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute, which allows the including set operator to exclude aut-nums, as-sets, and route-sets, from the included set, or exclude the included set entirely.</t>

<section anchor="the-as-set-class"><name>The as-set Class</name>

<t>The new <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute on the as-set class uses almost exactly the same syntax as the existing <spanx style="verb">members</spanx> attribute from <xref section="5.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC2622"/>, in that one or more RPSL primary keys of an aut-num or as-set may be specified. The only difference is that when an as-set is specified in <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx>, the as-set primary key <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prefixed with a registry name and a double colon (e.g., <spanx style="verb">SOURCE::</spanx>). This requirement is to ensure that the correct object is being excluded due to the inherent ambiguity of as-set primary keys in the existing IRR ecosystem (as documented in <xref target="draft-romijn-grow-rpsl-registry-scoped-members"/>).</t>

<section anchor="attribute-validation"><name>Attribute Validation</name>

<t>When an authoritative IRR registry processes an as-set or route-set object with the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute present, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> validate the contents of the attribute.</t>

<section anchor="registry-scoped-keys-only"><name>Registry Scoped Keys Only</name>

<t>All primary keys in <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have a registry scope provided with the exception of an AS number.</t>

<t>By requiring registry scoped as-set and route-set keys to be used in the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute, it becomes possible to have multiple references to the same RPSL primary key. This is not permitted, and IRR registry software <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reject this:</t>

<figure title="Invalid object fragment using multiple registry prefixes with the same RPSL primary key"><sourcecode type="rpsl"><![CDATA[
excl-members: RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE, ARIN::AS-EXAMPLE
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>The IRR registry software <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that without their registry prefix, all references from <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> are unique.</t>

<t>If allowed, the attribute <spanx style="verb">excl-members: RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE, ARIN::AS-EXAMPLE</spanx> would refer to two different set objects, whereas the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute can only contain one instance of <spanx style="verb">AS-EXAMPLE</spanx>, which is ambiguous as to which set this refers to when sets exist in multiple registries with the same primary key.</t>

<t>Similarly, the IRR software <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> allow for the registry scopes in the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute and the <spanx style="verb">src-members</spanx> attribute to be mixed, when both attributes are populated on the same set object, and when they referencing the same primary key with the registry scope removed.</t>

<t>If allowed, due to the presence of the <spanx style="verb">src-members</spanx> attribute, ARIN::AS-EXAMPLE is included instead of AS-EXAMPLE (<spanx style="verb">src-members</spanx> is taking preference over <spanx style="verb">members</spanx>), and the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute value RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE wouldn't match the <spanx style="verb">src-members</spanx> value.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="any-primary-key-and-registry-scope"><name>Any Primary Key and Registry Scope</name>

<t>The IRR software <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> require that the primary key of an entry in the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute is a direct member of the object being updated. The <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute is used to exclude objects anywhere in the hierarchy, starting from the point of definition.</t>

<t>The IRR software <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> require that the registry scope which precedes the object primary key, is a registry the IRR software knows to be a valid registry. An authoritative IRR server may have it's content mirrored to resolver IRR servers, which have visibility of many more registries.</t>

as-set: RS-EXAMPLE-1
members: 192.0.2.0/25, 2001:db8::/33, 192.0.2.128/25
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>It can be seen that <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> took effect on the object it was defined on, not just it's descendants. This is shown by 2001:db8:8000::/33 not being included in the final result because RS-EXAMPLE-4 is both a <spanx style="verb">member</spanx> <em>and</em> <spanx style="verb">excl-member</spanx> of RS-EXAMPLE-2.</t>
  <t>Even though RS-EXAMPLE-4 is excluded by RS-EXAMPLE-2, it was also included by RS-EXAMPLE-3, but still 2001:db8:8000::/33 is excluded. This shows that the exclusion logic applies from the point in the hierarchy where it is defined, all the way down, taking precedence over any subsequent includes.</t>
  <t>RS-EXAMPLE-4 is excluded even though RS-EXAMPLE-4 is defined in ARIN and RIPE::RS-EXAMPLE-4 is specified in <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> on RS-EXAMPLE-2. This is because the AS-EXAMPLE-4 entry in the <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> attribute of RS-EXAMPLE-3 is ambiguous due to the lack of <spanx style="verb">src-members</spanx> attribute on RS-EXAMPLE-3. This means that the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> value RIPE::RS-EXAMPLE-4 has to be checked against the <spanx style="verb">members</spanx> attribute on RS-EXAMPLE-3 with the registry scope removed.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="cumulative-excludes"><name>Cumulative Excludes</name>

<t>As as-set or route-set objects are recursively resolved and <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attributes are discovered, the RPSL primary keys to be excluded need to be tracked. At any point in the hierarchy where <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> is discovered, all <spanx style="verb">(mp-)members</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">src-members</spanx> attributes from that point onwards are subject to the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> which have been discovered so far. However, depending on the resolution algorithm being used by the resolving software i.e., a depth first search or breadth first search, multiple lists of RPSL keys to exclude may have to be maintained (the exact implementation details are outside the scope of this document).</t>

<t>This section does not aim to define how the logic should be implemented in software, simply to demonstrate that the exclusion list is cumulative, but not as simple as a single global list.</t>

<t>The following figure shows as-set objects in their unresolved state:</t>

<figure title="An example as-set hierarchy, in it's unresolved state"><sourcecode type="rpsl"><![CDATA[
as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-1
members: AS-EXAMPLE-2, AS-EXAMPLE-3
excl-members: RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE-4

as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-2
members: AS-EXAMPLE-4
excl-members: RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE-5

as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-4

as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-3
members: AS-EXAMPLE-5
excl-members: AS65006

as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-5

]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t>The following figure shows the resolved members of as-set AS-EXAMPLE-1:</t>

<figure title="AS-EXAMPLE-1 in it's resolved state with exclusions applied"><sourcecode type="rpsl"><![CDATA[
as-set: AS-EXAMPLE-1
members: AS65005
]]></sourcecode></figure>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t>The resolving process starts by resolving the members of AS-EXAMPLE-1.</t>
  <t>If a depth first search approach is taken by the IRR software, AS-EXAMPLE-2 might be resolved next. AS-EXAMPLE-4 is not included due to the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute defined on AS-EXAMPLE-1. This is being applied from the point of definition onwards, the resolving process inherited the currently defined list of excludes (RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE-4) when it moved on to resolve AS-EXAMPLE-2.</t>
  <t>AS-EXAMPLE-2 defined a new <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute with the value RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE-5 however, there is nothing left to resolve in AS-EXAMPLE-2 so this exclusion has no effect.</t>
  <t>Continuing the depth first search approach, the IRR software returns to AS-EXAMPLE-1, and uses the exclusion list as it existed whilst resolving AS-EXAMPLE1-1 (it contains only RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE-4), and now begins to resolve AS-EXAMPLE-3.</t>
  <t>AS-EXAMPLE-3 includes AS-EXAMPLE-5. This is not excluded even though the IRR software has encountered an <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute which contains the value RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE-5. This is because that <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute was found on a different branch of the hierarchy.</t>
  <t>Continuing the resolution process, resolving AS-EXAMPLE-5 returns AS65005 only. The exclusion of AS65006 defined on AS-EXAMPLE-3 was applied to the resolution of AS-EXAMPLE-5 in addition to the exclusion of RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE-4, however no <spanx style="verb">members</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">src-members</spanx> attributes were found on AS-EXAMPLE-5 with these values.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The example shows that discovered exclusions do not apply across branches of the hierarchy. This <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be allowed by the software implementation. If allowed, the operator of an as-set or route-set would be able to excluded objects from other sets they are not responsible for.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="backwards-compatibility"><name>Backwards Compatibility</name>

<t>The behaviour or RPSL compliant software is to ignore unrecognised attributes. This means that adding the exclusion logic defined in this document based on the contents of a new attribute has no impact when existing IRR software implementations process an object with the new attribute defined.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iana-considerations"><name>IANA Considerations</name>

<t>This memo includes no request to IANA.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>This document adds the ability to specify that IRR derived prefix and AS path filter lists may exclude specific entries, which may be the cause of security issue, that are presently included by the existing greedy logic.</t>

<t>It is possible that the operator of an including set includes the wrong primary key in the <spanx style="verb">excl-members</spanx> attribute. However, this is not a new issue, it has long been possible to include the unintended primary keys in set objects. This document doesn't change this existing behaviour.</t>

<t>Great progress has been made with the deployment of Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) as defined in <xref target="RFC9582"/>, and the ongoing development of Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) objects as defined in <xref target="draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification"/>. The method proposed in this document in intended to compliment those existing developments, further enriching the existing operator's toolkit, and not work against them or be mutually exclusive.</t>
